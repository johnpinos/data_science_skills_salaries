## Context
The objective of this analysis is to identify which technical skills offer the highest return in terms of salary and demand within the data science field, in order to support strategic decisions in professional development.

The data used is from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql) and has been adapted to focus specifically on Data Scientist roles.

### Key Questions
The SQL queries developed in this project aim to answer the following core questions:

1. What are the highest-paying Data Scientist positions?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying roles?
3. Which competencies are most in demand for Data Scientists today?
4. Which skills are associated with the highest average salaries?
5. Which skills are most strategic when considering both demand and compensation?

## Tools Used
To efficiently and systematically analyze the data science job market, the following tools were employed:

- **SQL:** The primary language for extracting, transforming, and analyzing job posting data.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system selected for its robustness, reliability, and widespread adoption in professional environments.
- **Visual Studio Code:** The development environment used to write and execute SQL queries, offering flexibility and strong extension support.
- **Git and GitHub:** Essential tools for version control, project documentation, and publishing the analysis in an organized and transparent manner.

## Analysis
Each of the questions posed in this project is intended to examine key aspects of the data science job market. Below is a breakdown of the approach used to address each of them:

### 1. Highest-Paid Data Scientist Positions
The top 10 highest-paying remote job positions for the role of *Data Scientist* were identified, considering only those listings that specify an annual salary.

```sql
SELECT
  jp.job_id,
  jp.job_title,
  c.name AS company_name,
  jp.job_location,
  jp.job_schedule_type,
  jp.salary_year_avg,
  jp.job_posted_date
FROM (
    -- Assign ranking by job title according to annual salary (desc)
  SELECT
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    PARTITION BY job_title
      ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    ) AS rn
  FROM job_postings_fact
  WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'  -- Data scientist positions
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere' -- Remote work only
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL -- Ensures valid salary data
) jp

### 5. Optimal Skills: High Demand and High Salary
This analysis identifies the most strategic skills for data scientists by combining two key criteria: high job demand and high average salary. The study focused exclusively on remote jobs with specified compensation

```sql
-- CTE 1: Count the number of posts per skill (Reuse query 3)
WITH skills_demand AS( 
  SELECT 
    sj.skill_id,
    s.skills,
    COUNT(sj.job_id) AS demand_count
  FROM job_postings_fact jp
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sj ON jp.job_id = sj.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim s ON sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
  WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
  GROUP BY sj.skill_id, s.skills
), 
-- CTE 2: Calculate the average annual salary by skill (Reuse query 4)
average_salary AS( 
  SELECT 
    sj.skill_id,
    s.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
  FROM job_postings_fact jp
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sj ON jp.job_id = sj.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim s ON sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
  WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
  GROUP BY sj.skill_id, s.skills
)
-- Main consultation: demonstrates skills that are in high demand and well paid.
SELECT 
  skills_demand.skill_id,
  skills_demand.skills,
  demand_count,
  avg_salary
FROM
  skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE  
  demand_count > 10 -- Filter skills with sufficient volume
ORDER BY
  demand_count DESC, -- Prioritize by demand
  avg_salary DESC -- Then by salary
LIMIT 10; -- Show the top 10

## Conclusions
This project enabled the extraction of key insights about the data science job market, with a particular focus on remote positions. Based on the analysis, the following conclusions stand out:

1. **Demand vs. compensation:** Not all high-demand skills are the highest paid. Some, although less popular, offer high profitability.
2. **Essential languages:** Python is established as the indispensable language. SQL remains relevant in nearly every job posting.
3.  **Emerging trends:** Cloud infrastructure, data orchestration, and automation are rising in both demand and salary.
4. **Technical specialization:** Mastering specific technical tools can open opportunities in better-paid and less competitive roles.
5. **Strategic recommendation:** It is advisable to combine widely used skills (Python, SQL) with high-value specializations (cloud, machine learning, automation).

This analysis provides an objective and actionable foundation for planning a professional development path in data science.
